Very quick version of how Backupberg works, starting from bare metal and ending up with a working backup solution.

1) hook up disk trays to linux
2) isolate an authoritative device name for each drive with multipath
3) design and build a raid / filesystem that meets your needs
4) design and configure a snapshot / archiving scheme that meets your needs
5) actually start bringing in data
6) monitoring drives for failure
7) replacing drives when failure happens
